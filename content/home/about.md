# Biography

I was born in 1985 in Tarragona, Spain. Since I was a child I have always loved computers and games. So it's not surprising that I became a software engineer.

I am passionate about new technologies and everything that moves around software. I enjoy making efficient clean code and improving my skills as a programmer. In the last years I have been mainly working with web services and applications.

Whenever I have some time off I enjoy running, riding my motorbike, watching TV series and traveling to discover new places and cultures.
